Some notes on the Dart programming language

## Purpose
As I study the [Dart programming language](https://www.dartlang.org/), I will take notes and run some experiments in code. This seems like a logical repository for such items.

## Table of Contents
* [Hello World](hello_world.dart) - An example of the basic "hello world" code.
* [Comments](comments.dart) - The different kinds of Dart comments.
* [Typing](typing.md) - Explanation of the type system Dart uses.

## Licensing
I have not yet decided what kind of licensing I will use on this project. Since these are notes, I'm leaning towards a Creative Commons license of some sort ... but I could easily lean another direction. I'll make the decision once I have more notes in place.
